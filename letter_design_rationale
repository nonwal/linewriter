Assuming that the Twiddler is set up so that the pinky can reach the outside button, middle row is fastest for most fingers, followed by outside row and inside row. The pinky, being shorter, has about same speed for inside and middle row, but outside row is slower.

Starting point is Cool Hand 1KCs
	• Space, Enter, Backspace set to mouse buttons
	• Add LDU on bottom row
	• Swap A and L to increase vowel clearance
	• C is next most frequent—center middle/ring for vowel stride and CT/CH stutter, also smaller travel to CR/CS/CL etc
  • M commonly paired with all vowels—outside middle/ring for vowel stride
	• G on ring/pinky for vowel stride and NG stride, center for GH stutter
	• Y very frequent in YO, less frequent for EY/YE, extremely infrequent for IY/YI--good candidate for outside index/middle, also RY stutter and AY/LY/YS stride
	• F commonly paired with vowels (U least frequent) as well as FL/LF/FR--inside ring/pinky allows for stutter with A/L bigrams and FR/top vowel stride
	• W common with both vowels (E, O, and A most frequently) and H—center index/middle allows for A/H stride and E stutter, at expense of short O travel
	• P on outside ring/pinky for UP/PU/MP stutter and PR/top vowel stride. Note long travel for A and L bigrams
	• B on inside middle/ring for vowel stride and BL stutter. Note long travel for BR/MB
	• K common with top row vowels, CK, and A—center 0MMM gives CK stutter and top vowel stride, plus short travel for A bigrams
	• V common with top row vowels and A—inside 0RRR gives AV/VA stutter and top vowel stride
	• J most common bigrams are JU/JO, then JE and JA, and very infrequent for IJ/JI--good candidate for outside LLL0 for JU/JA stride and JO stutter, short travel for JE. Note long travel for BJ
	• X very common with E, C, T--center MMM0 for E, C, T stutter and short travel for IX/XI/OX
	• Z common with I, A, E, relatively uncommon with O--only real candidate for RR00, but giving such an uncommon letter a 2KC seems ridiculous. Placed at RRR0, leaving RR00 as a free space (later filled by ING trigram)
	• Q common with QU, somewhat common with EQ/SQ--excellent candidate for 0LLL
